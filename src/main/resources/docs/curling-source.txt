==Qualification==
{{main|Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification}}
Qualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 [[World Curling Championships]]. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.<ref>[https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media.worldcurling.org/media.worldcurling.org/wcf_worldcurling/2019/09/06193637/Resolutions-put-to-the-Annual-General-Assembly-2019.pdf Rule changes outlined]</ref>

For the mixed doubles competition in 2022, the tournament field was expanded from eight competitor nations to ten.<ref name="doubles"/> The top seven ranked teams at the [[2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship]] qualified, along with two teams from the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE) – Mixed Doubles. This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcurling.org/beijing-named-host-city-of-olympic-winter-games-2022|title = Beijing named host city of Olympic Winter Games 2022|date = 31 July 2015}}</ref>
